# FrontEndTraining_TASK1
This task was done as a part of the frontend training at Harri.
The task was to create two web pages from the design provided in the screenshots with the task using only basic HTML and CSS.
The first page contains a list of countries, and the second page has more details about a country. For now, every country you click redirects you to the page containing info about Belgium, because there is no Javascript yet.
Included here are the screenshots of the result of this task:
